# LawIntern Project
    
LawIntern is a web-based data management platform that allows users to upload CSV files, validate data with Pydantic models, and store it securely in a MySQL database. It supports real-time schema visualization and data encryption for sensitive fields.

## Setup 
|-- Go to setup.txt

## App flow

Configuration:

    User sets up data configuration through the /config form. The configuration is stored in data_source_config.json for modular processing and validation.

File Upload:

    User uploads a CSV file via the /uploads endpoint. The uploaded file is saved to the uploads/ directory.

Data Extraction and Processing:

    The file is processed using uploadCsv.py, which calls extractData.py for data extraction.Data is transformed and prepared using utility functions from dataUpload/tools.

Data Validation:

    Extracted data is validated against the user-defined configuration using Pydantic models from utils/dynamic_models.py. This ensures consistency and accuracy before insertion.

Data Encryption:

    Sensitive fields are encrypted using the functions from dataBase/encrypt.py.

Database Insertion:

    Validated and encrypted data is inserted into the relational database using dataFrameToTable.py. The database structure is maintained and managed via dbBuilder.py.

Success Message:
    A success message is displayed upon successful validation and database insertion.
